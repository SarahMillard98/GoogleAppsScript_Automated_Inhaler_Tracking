# Google Apps Script for Automated Inhaler Dose Tracking

I have a cat with asthma, and it can be hard to keep track of how many doses are left in her inhaler. 
I created this script to automatically fill in the date & time the dose was given and the number of doses left in the inhaler, just by clicking a checkbox.
It does require a little bit of setup in the sheet, though it isnt difficult. 
Inhalers require you to prime them (shaking and dispensing a dose into the air) before use. 
Inputting this dose manually into the first row allows automatic tracking for the rest of the doses in the inhaler.
