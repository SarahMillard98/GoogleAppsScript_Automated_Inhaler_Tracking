# Google Apps Script for Automated Inhaler Dose Tracking

I have a cat with asthma, and it can be hard to keep track of how many doses are left in her inhaler.

I created this script to automatically fill in the date/time when the dose was given and the number of doses left in the inhaler.  
Just check the next box in the 'Inhaler Given' column!

It does require a bit of setup in the sheet, though it isn't difficult.   
Inhalers require you to prime them (shaking and dispensing a dose into the air) before their first use.   
Inputting this dose manually into the first row allows automatic tracking for the rest of the doses in the inhaler.
